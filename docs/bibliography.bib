abstract = {After a natural disaster or other crisis, humanitarian organizations need to know where affected people are located and what resources they need. While this information is difficult to capture quickly through conventional methods, aggregate usage patterns of social media apps like Facebook can help fill these information gaps. This talk will describe the data and methodology that power Facebook Disaster Maps. These maps utilize information about Facebook usage in areas impacted by natural hazards, producing insights into how the population is affected by and responding to the hazard. In addition to methodology details, including efforts taken to ensure the security and privacy of Facebook users, I'll also discuss how we worked with humanitarian partners to develop the maps, which are actively used in disaster response today. I'll give examples of insights generated from the maps and I'll also discuss some limitations of the current methodologies, challenges, and opportunities for improvement.},

  abstract = "The implementation of large-scale containment measures by
              governments to contain the spread of the COVID-19 virus has
              resulted in large impacts to the global economy. Here, we derive
              a new high-frequency indicator of economic activity using
              empirical vessel tracking data, and use it to estimate the global
              maritime trade losses during the first eight months of the
              pandemic. We go on to use this high-frequency dataset to infer
              the effect of individual non-pharmaceutical interventions on
              maritime exports, which we use as a proxy of economic activity.
              Our results show widespread port-level trade losses, with the
              largest absolute losses found for ports in China, the Middle-East
              and Western Europe, associated with the collapse of specific
              supply-chains (e.g. oil, vehicle manufacturing). In total, we
              estimate that global maritime trade reduced by -7.0\% to -9.6\%
              during the first eight months of 2020, which is equal to around
              206-286 million tonnes in volume losses and up to 225-412 billion
              USD in value losses. We find large sectoral and geographical
              disparities in impacts. Manufacturing sectors are hit hardest,
              with losses up to 11.8\%, whilst some small islands developing
              states and low-income economies suffered the largest relative
              trade losses. Moreover, we find a clear negative impact of
              COVID-19 related school and public transport closures on
              country-wide exports. Overall, we show how real-time indicators
              of economic activity can inform policy-makers about the impacts
              of individual policies on the economy, and can support economic
              recovery efforts by allocating funds to the hardest hit economies
              and sectors.",
